# AGTimer

AGTimer is a simple, interactive countdown timer app built with SwiftUI. It allows users to start, pause, and stop a timer, with visual progress represented by a circular ring. The app is designed to be intuitive and responsive with modern SwiftUI components.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: A timer that counts down from a specified initial time, showing the remaining time in seconds.
- **Progress Ring**: A circular ring that fills as the timer counts down.
- **Start/Pause Button**: Start or pause the timer with a single button.
- **Stop Button**: Stop the timer at any point.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adapts to different device screen sizes, with buttons fixed at the bottom of the screen.
